What is the output of the following code?~~int x = 15;~if (x == 10)~    System.out.println("x is 10");~else if (x == 15)~    System.out.println("x is 15");~else if (x > 20)~    System.out.println("x is greater than 20");~else~    System.out.println("No match");$,x is 10$,x is 15$,x is greater than 20$,No match$,2$,'x' = 15
Which of the following is true about an else block?$,It must always come after an if block.$,It can be placed before the if block.$,It can execute code even if the if condition is true.$,It must always follow an else if block.$,1$,'else' must always come after an if block
Given the following code, what will be printed?~~int num = 9;~if (num % 2 == 0)~    System.out.println("Even");~else~    System.out.println("Odd");$,Even$,Odd$,Not Even$,No output$,2$,9 is an odd number so 9 % 2 = 1
Which of the following is a valid expression inside an if statement?$,if (10 + 5 == 15)$,if (x + y == 10)$,if (true)$,All of the above$,4$,All the expression are valid.
In the following code, what will be printed?~~int x = 8;~if (x > 5)~    if (x > 10)~        System.out.println("x is greater than 10");~    else if (x > 7)~        System.out.println("x is greater than 7 but less than or equal to 10");~    else~        System.out.println("x is less than or equal to 7");$,x is greater than 10$,x is greater than 7 but less than or equal to 10$,x is less than or equal to 7$,No output$,2$,8 is greater than 7 but less than or equal to 10
Given the following code, what will be the output~~int x = 2, y = 4, z = 6;~if (x < y && z > y)~    if (x + z > y)~        System.out.println("Condition A met");~    else~        System.out.println("Condition B met");~else~    System.out.println("Condition C met");$,Condition A met$,Condition B met$,Condition C met$,No output$,1$,2 < 4 and 4 < 6 and 2 + 6 > 4
Which of the following is the correct way to check if a variable x is between 10 and 20, inclusive?$,if (x > 10 && x < 20)$,if (x >= 10 && x <= 20)$,if (x == 10 || x == 20)$,if (x >= 10 || x <= 20)$,2$,Because x needs to be more than 10 and less than 20.
What is the output for the following program?~~int score = 85;~if (score >= 90) {~    System.out.println("A");~} else if (score >= 80) {~    if (score > 84) {~        System.out.println("A-");~    } else {~        System.out.println("B+");~    }~}$,A$,A-$,B+$,F$,2$,85 is more than 84 and less than 90.
