1$,2$,3$,4$,5$,5$,.
What does the following code output?~ System.out.println("Hello, World!");$,Hello, World!$,Hello$,World!$,Error$,1$,The System.out.println command outputs the text inside the quotes without the quotes themselves.
What does the following code output if the user enters `Alice`?~ Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);~ System.out.print("Enter your name: ");~ String name = scanner.nextLine();~ System.out.println("Hello, " + name);$,"Hello, Alice$,Alice!$,Hello$,Error$,1$,The Scanner reads the user's input and stores it in the `name` variable. The System.out.println command concatenates the text with the variable `name`.
What does the following code output if the user enters `10`?~ Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);~ System.out.print("Enter a number: ");~ int number = scanner.nextInt();~ System.out.println("You entered:" + number);$,You entered: 10$,You entered: `10`$,Enter a number: 10$,Error$,1$,"The Scanner reads the user's input as an integer, and System.out.println outputs the text concatenated with the number.
What does the following code output?~ System.out.println(5 + 3);$,1$,8$,9$,5$,2$, The + operator adds the two integers, so the output is 8.
What does the following code output?~ System.out.println("Hello");~ System.out.println("World");$,Prints "Hello World" on the same line$,Prints "Hello" and "World" on different lines$,Prints "Hello World" with a space in between$, Causes an error$,2$,The System.out.println command are move to a new line,so the output will be in separate lines.
What does the following code output?~ Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);~ System.out.print("Enter your name: ");~String name = scanner.nextLine();$, Prompts the user to enter their name.$,Prints "Enter your name: ".$,Causes an error.$,Nothing$,4$,The Scanner reads input from the user, storing it in the variable name but we didn't print it.
What does the following code output?~ int a = 5, b = 3;~ System.out.println("The sum is " + (a + b));$, Prints: The sum is 8$, Prints: The sum is 5 + 3$,Causes an error$,Prints: The sum is ab$,1$,The parentheses ensure that the addition happens before concatenation with the string.
