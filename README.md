## Architecture üß©

The CodeCraze project employs a modular and scalable architecture, ensuring a seamless learning experience for young programmers. Below is an overview of the core components:
<br />

### 1. Client-Side (Unity3D)
- **Technology**: Unity3D with C# scripts.  
- **Purpose**: Manages the 3D game environment, user interactions, and educational missions.  
- **Features**:  
  - Real-time gameplay interactions and animations.  
  - Missions designed to teach Java programming basics.  
  - User authentication and data synchronization with the server.  


### 2. Server-Side (Node.js + Express.js)
- **Technology**: Node.js with the Express framework.  
- **Purpose**: Handles API requests, user management, and communication between the client and database.  
- **Features**:  
  - RESTful API endpoints for user data retrieval and storage.  
  - Secure authentication and session management.  
  - Data validation to ensure consistency.  


### 3. Database (MongoDB)
- **Technology**: MongoDB (NoSQL database).  
- **Purpose**: Stores user data, mission progress, and game configurations.  
- **Features**:  
  - User profiles, including usernames, passwords, and progress.  
  - Mission-specific data, such as completion status.  
  - Flexible schema for future scalability.  


### 4. Communication
- **Protocol**: HTTPS.  
- **Purpose**: Ensures secure data exchange between the client, server, and database.  
- **Features**:  
  - JSON-based API requests and responses. 


### 5. Development Environment
- **Local Deployment**: The project runs entirely on local machines for development and testing.  
- **Source Control**: Git and GitHub are used for version control and collaboration.  
- **Testing and Debugging**: All components were tested locally using debugging tools.
